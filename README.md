# Titanic Classification Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for solving the Titanic classification problem using machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which provides information about passengers aboard the Titanic.

## Project Overview
- Data exploration and visualization
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation using machine learning algorithms
- Performance metrics and model comparison

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Usage
Open the `main.ipynb` file and follow the steps in the notebook to run the analysis and train the models.
